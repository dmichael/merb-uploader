== Merb Upload Server

Very simple upload server using DataMapper and a modified attachmerb_fu that is meant to handle uploads (and other possible processing of the upload) from a primary server application. This does not work with ActiveRecord yet, but may be fruitful to have an ActiveRecord model in the "host" application.  I have included a sample migration in schema/migrations to run from a Rails host. Alternatively, you can run rake dm:db:automigrate with the config pointed to a shared database.

To use Amazon S3, create a file conig/amazon_s3.yml following the conventions in gems/attachmerb_fu .. amazon_s3.yml.tpl

TODO:
- Make the Asset class configurable
- Make this work with ActiveRecord
- Integrate with SWFUpload
